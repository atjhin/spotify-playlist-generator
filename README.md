# Spotify Playlist Generator

## Overview

Spotify Playlist Generator is a Python-based application that helps you organize your messy playlists by automatically grouping them into specific categories with auto-generated playlist names, such as "Late Night Drive" or "Study Cram Session". This project leverages the GPT-4 model to analyze the music's audio features and create curated playlists based on your preferences.

## Features

- **Automated Playlist Grouping**: Input a messy playlist, and the app will split it into well-defined playlists based on specific moods or themes.
- **Customizable Playlist Types**: Define your own playlist categories or use the default ones provided by the app.
- **Integration with Spotify API**: Fetch your playlists directly from Spotify.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple command-line interface (CLI) to interact with the app.
- **Create Playlists Directly in Spotify**: Easily add the generated playlists into your Spotify account
